            <strong>Boxtribute</strong> is a solution that works hand-in-hand with actors in the field to deliver aid to people in these situations quickly and fairly.
            <br /> <br />
            <strong>Vulnerable people</strong> in emergency scenarios are often stripped of their <strong>dignity</strong> and <strong>self-determination</strong>.
            <br /> <br />
            We think aid works best when delivery is supported by systems that:
            <li>encourage <strong>solidarity</strong> between recipients and aid workers, </li>
            <li>respect the <strong>needs</strong> of the recipients through choice,</li>
            <li>reflect <strong>best practice</strong> in humanitarian logistics.</li>

        <div id="description">
            Our story begins in a refugee camp in Northern Greece in autumn 2016. We are volunteers with Drop In The Ocean - a Norwegian NGO. Our task is to distribute donations like clothes, hygiene products or food.
            <br />
            <br />
            To treat everyone in a fair and respectful way, Drop in the Ocean opens a “Free Shop”. Here, residents of the camp can choose themselves what they need. They pay with Drops - a virtual currency for the shop only. Every resident gets Drops every week. 
            <br />
            <br />
            To keep track of the accounts and the transactions, we are building an app. This is the start of Boxwise.</div>
